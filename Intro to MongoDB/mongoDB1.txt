1. What is a NoSQL Database, and explain the types of NoSQL database?
ANS :   NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. 
        NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.



2. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
ANS :                SQL                                                        ||                      NoSQL 
      . Data is presnet in table format                                                 . Data is present in non-tabluar format example: key-value pair, graph etc
      . There is a relation between each data with the column of the table              . There may or may not be reation from one data to another
      . Is structured and not flexible                                                  . Is not structured and flexible



3. How to choose between MongoDB and MySQL based on your requirements?
ANS : If the requirement is to store unstructured data, then it is best to choose MongoDB as it stores data easily. 
      If the requirement is to store structured data for analysis and query, it is best to choose MySQL. 



4. What are collections and documents in a MongoDB database?
ANS : Collections : In the hierarchy of MongoDB, collections are the group of documents. Documents in a collection can have different fields. Documents in a collection have a similar or related purpose.
      Documents : Documents is the basic unit of MongoDB. It stores the data in BSON documents. 
      Example: In Movies database, Genres can be considered as colelctions, like horror genre is a colelction, fiction genre is a collection.
                Similarly, in horror genre, each movie in that genre can be called a document. Like movie Conjuring in horror genre is a document. 



5. What is BSON? What is the difference between BSON and JSON?
ANS : BSON is a binary-encoded serialization format that is compact and efficient for storing data or transmitting over a network.
                        BSON                              ||                   JSON
        . Binary encoded format                                           . Text encoded format
        . Supports additional data types such as                          . Supports strings, numbers, null, arrays, and objects
          binary data and date types
        . Only supported by MongoDB                                       . Can be used with a wide range of databases and programming languages



6. What are MongoDB Compass and MongoDB Shell used for?
ANS : Mongo Compass is a GUI for querying, aggregating, and analyzing MongoDB data in a visual environment.
      MongoDB Shell is an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB. You can use the mongo shell to query and update data as well as perform administrative operations.



7. How to create collections in MongoDB?
ANS : Creating collections can be done using queries in MongoDB. 
      db.createCollection("any_name")   --> this query will create a collection name called 'any_name'



8. What is the difference between insertMany and insertOne?
ANS : insertOne can be used to insert one document at a time. Example: db.collectionName.insertOne({name:"Person1"})
      insertMany is used when we need to insert many documents at a time. Example: db.collectionName.insertMany([{name:"Person1"},{name:"Person2"},{name:"Person3"}]).
      Here array is used for inserting more than 1 document.



9. What is the difference between deleteOne and deleteMany?
ANS : deleteOne will delete first matching document in a collection. 
      deleteMany will delete all matching documents in a collection. 



10. How to read data in MongoDB? What is the difference between find and findOne?
ANS : Read data in MongoDB by using query --> db.collectionName.find() 
      This will give all the documents present in the collectionName. 
      'find' will return all the documents while 'findOne' will return only one document even if there are many documents. 



11. What is $set in MongoDB?
ANS : $set is used when we need to update new field-value pair or replace the value of the field in the document.   



12. How to filter data using MongoDB?
ANS : Filter can be done in MongoDB using query --> db.collectionName.find({filter}) 
      Here is 'filter', we can give the field-value to filter the document in the collection. 
      example: db.collectionName.find({name: "Person1"}) --> returns the document in which Person1 value is present.
